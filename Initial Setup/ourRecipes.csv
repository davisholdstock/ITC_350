5,5,"“For the Dough Pour yeast into a large bowl$ and add warm water. Allow it to sit (active yeast will become foamy) for 3-5 minutes. Add warm whole milk$ granulated sugar$ and beaten egg. Stir together with a dough whisk$ or rubber spatula. Add 1 1/2 cups of flour and stir until incorporated. Add salt and butter$ stir again. Add remaining 1 1/2 cups of flour gradually. The dough should be pulling away from the sides of the bowl$ but still sticky to the touch. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap$ and set in a warm place to rise for 1 hour$ or until doubled in size. Once the dough has risen$ it may be refrigerated (keep well covered) for up to 12 hours or overnight. When you are ready to make the kolaches$ pour the dough out onto a well-floured surface. Roll the dough out 1/2 inch thick$ and cut 2 1/2 inch circles out of the dough. Re-roll excess dough$ and cut again. I got about 18 rounds from this recipe. Place them on parchment lined baking sheets. Cover and let them rise for 45 minutes in a warm place. For the Filling In the meantime$ make the cream cheese filling. In a medium bowl$ use an electric mixer to whisk the cream cheese$ egg$ powdered sugar$ and vanilla extract until smooth. Set aside. When the dough rounds have risen$ preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Use the bottom of a glass or measuring cup to press a deep well into the center of each dough round. Fill each well with about two tablespoons of cream cheese filling. Swirl 1-2 teaspoons of raspberry preserves into the filling of each well. For a golden sheen$ brush the outer rim of the dough with an egg wash (1 egg beaten + 1 teaspoon water) before baking. Bake at 375 degrees for 11-14 minutes$ or until light golden brown. Transfer to a cooling rack$ and then dust with powdered sugar.”

5,2,Choose limes that have a thin skin. They should be smooth and easier to squeeze than limes with a thick rind. You will be that weirdo squeezing all the limes at the grocery store. Embrace it. Chop all 5 limes into small 1 inch chunks$ see photos. Add 2 cups ice water to a blender. You can leave in a few ice cubes if you want$ 5-8 is fine. Not too many$ you want to make sure you have enough liquid. Add the chopped limes to the blender. Blend in pulses for no more than a total of 15 seconds. Do not over blend; your limeade will get bitter from the lime piths! Set a strainer over a large glass measuring cup$ or over a bowl with a spout.* Pour the mixture through the strainer. Use a rubber spatula or your hands to press the blended limes as much as possible to get out as much liquid as you can. Pour the strained liquid back into the blender. Add a scant 2/3 cup sweetened condensed milk to the blender. (This is 10 tablespoons$ or you could measure it at 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons.) Blend again until it is nice and frothy. Serve immediately over a glass that is FULL of ice. It’s very important to serve Brazilian Lemonade cold! IMPORTANT! You must serve this drink IMMEDIATELY! Even waiting 20-30 minutes will not do. The longer it sits$ the more bitter it will become. This is because there is lime pith (the white stuff in between the flesh of the lime and the rind) in the drink$ and the bitterness of the pith takes over the sweetness the longer it sits. It’s super tasty served right away; not overly bitter at all. See notes for a Make Ahead Brazilian limeade recipe. This recipe makes about 3 cups. Don’t save leftovers. Don’t freeze leftovers. Live in the moment! CHUG CHUG CHUG!!!”,20,Brazilian Limeade,Side,brazilian_limeade.jpg

Whisk together the sauce ingredients: 1/2 cup milk$ cornstarch$ dry mustard$ and hot sauce. Add the mixture to the cooked noodles$ breaking up clumps of noodles as you stir to combine well. Add the cheese$ one handful at a time$ and stir until each addition is melted before adding more. Once all the cheese is melted$ season to taste with additional salt$ if needed.

4.8,3,"In a large bowl or the bowl of an electric mixer, add the flour, salt, sugar and yeast. Mix. Add the water. Mix well, adding more flour, if needed, a bit at a time to form a soft, smooth dough that clears the sides and bottom of the bowl. It should be soft but not overly sticky.
Knead for 4-5 minutes until the dough is soft and stretchy. Grease the inside of a gallon-size ziploc-type bag with nonstick cooking spray and place the dough inside. Close the bag, leaving room for the dough to expand, and let it rest for 20-30 minutes (or up to 60 minutes) until doubled in size. Alternately, the dough can rise in a lightly greased, covered bowl.
Preheat oven to 500°F. The high heat ensures the pretzels will brown beautifully on the outside while staying soft and chewy on the inside. Line two half sheet pans with parchment paper and lightly grease with cooking spray.
Transfer the dough to a lightly greased or floured work surface, and cut the dough into four thick strips. Cut each strip of dough into about 6-8 pieces. It doesn’t have to be exact.
Combine the very hot water and baking soda and whisk to combine well.
Dip each pretzel bite in the baking soda solution (this helps give the pretzels a nice, golden-brown color). Let the excess liquid drip off before placing the pretzel bites a couple inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.
Sprinkle the pretzel bites with coarse, kosher salt. Allow them to rest, uncovered, for about 10 minutes.
Bake the pretzels for 7-8 minutes until golden brown.
Remove the pretzels from the oven, and immediately brush them with the melted butter. Keep brushing the butter on until you’ve used it all up; it may seem like a lot, but that’s what gives these pretzels their ethereal taste.
