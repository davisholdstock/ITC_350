This is for our ITC_350 project


To get started for windows download both the <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/">MySQL community server</a>, and the <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/shell/">MySQL shell

Configure the Server, creating a password for the root user, which will be used to log in to the CLI.
